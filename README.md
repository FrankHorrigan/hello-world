hello-world
===========

hello world activity repository. (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

This is come text about myself. I think the hello world activity is poorly explained, and is written (deliberately
or otherwise) for those with a decent amount of prerequisite knowledge. This is how you turn away new coders.
